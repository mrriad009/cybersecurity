## 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Basics of Websites
A website is made of multiple components:

- **Front-end (Client-side)**: This is what you see (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- **Back-end (Server-side)**: This is what powers the website (PHP, Python, Node.js).
- **Database**: Stores website data (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How Websites Communicate (HTTP & HTTPS)
Websites use the **HTTP** protocol to communicate with users. Think of it as a conversation between your browser and a web server.

### üîπ HTTP Request Example (What your browser sends):
```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
